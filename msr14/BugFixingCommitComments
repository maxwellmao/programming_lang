This encoding defaults to UTF-8; however, it can be set only at time of construction (by using `fs.open`).

36ab7194e4a186fb929e7d555dbb0e4d4ec6ddd3	Use UTF-8 encoding for std{in,out,err}  This fixes issue #11162.  `File` constructor takes a `QTextCodec *`, codec; but, if codec is `NULL`, then it assumes "binary" mode, which causes non-ASCII characters to be converted to NUL (`\0`) in `File::write`.  This change passes the codec for UTF-8 to the `File` constructor for the `std{in,out,err}` instances, thus opening them in *text mode*.
8042f3b92c2a1a4d871174ae6e6e4dcaffdfaf87	Flush in `File::write` when in unbuffered "text" mode  If the wrapped `QFile` was opened with `QIODevice::Unbuffered`, any writes should be unbuffered.  However, as currently implemented, using `QTextStream` when the `File` is in "text" mode causes all reads/writes to be buffered.  This modification forces a flush in `File::write` if the wrapped `QFile` was opened with `QIODevice::Unbuffered`.  Necessary to fix issue #11162 https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/11162.

b1185cd22af96bda11592e311278f40d7f77c4e4	Redesign the Cookies API (part 2)  Addresses [Issue #761](http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/issues/detail?id=761).  This is a combination of 5 commits.  1. Date in Cookie can be set via "seconds since epoch" as well.  * In addition to the current string format, we can now set cookies via integer of msec since epoch * Expiration date can be set via "expires" or "expiry" option ("expires" has priority) * Returned cookie will contain "expires" as string and "expiry" as msec since epoch  I believe this can simplify code that uses cookies and it doesn't change the functionality.  2. Applying the "--debug" command line options as early as possible.  3. Fixing bug and behaviour in the CookieJar  * It's not possible to set a cookie without a domain: will default to the domain of the page it's set on * "page.clearCookies()" was broken * "cookiejar.deleteCookie("name", url)" reimplemented because deleting via "expiration" doesn't work  4. Improving (and more fixing) in the CookieJar  * Purging Session or Expired Cookies now works * Added boolean return values to inform if the requested cookie operation succeeded * Timestamps for "expiry/expires" in Milliseconds, as JS does by default * Improved detection that a cookie has been accepted or rejected by the cookiejar  NOTE: Unfortunately, the Qt provided QNetworkCookieJar is a very limited and not extremely well designed solution. It doesn't provide any "nice and clean" CRUD API, and you are only left with a SET/GET to deal with. Mechanism to understand when and when not a cookie is added are hidden, and require extra work in the sub-class (our CookieJar) to fill the gap.  5. Methods on the "phantom" object to manipulate the CookieJar.  * phantom.cookies (array of JSON/Cookies) * phantom.cookiesEnabled (boolean) * phantom.addCookie * phantom.deleteCookie * phantom.clearCookies  Those methods operate on the CookieJar directly and have no URL restriction. In other words, if page P1 can see set of cookies C1, and page P2 can see set of cookies C2, "phantom.cookies" can see (i.e. operate upon) both C1 and C2.

bd2137373225c21d016c755c190ff042c2ccbf65	Redesign the Cookies API  Addresses [Issue #761](http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/issues/detail?id=761).  This is a squash of 5 commits.  1. Complete reimplementation of the CookieJar and the Cookie API - Part 1.  The save/load mechanism is inspired by the Qt Demo "browser". More info: http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7-snapshot/demos-browser.html  2. Making the CookieJar a singleton.  We need to have multiple NetworkAccessManager to monitor the network activity of the page, but we also need to maintain 1 CookieJar: in this way we now have a shared bucket of Cookies.  3. Exposing the new Cookies API to the JS space.  * Updated the completions. * Ensured backward compatibility of the API. * It's now possible to "phantom.cookieEnabled = false" to disable cookies completely. * New methods: addCookie, deleteCookie, clearCookies  4. Provided some internal Doc for the new Cookies API  5. Ensuring the "page.deleteCookie(name)" method works only if a cookie name is given.
6217d6b9608b35b5ae9c3bce9bc4fb1f79a6e512	Adding "url" and some frame-related Q_PROPERTIES  * url - current page url * frameUrl - current frame url * frameContent - current frame HTML content * framePlainText - current frame content in Plain Text (no tags)  Fixes [Issue #758](http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/issues/detail?id=758)

43c97295fe42ad21941fa94637c2e783733d6d63	Task #906853: Implement ThreadLocalServiceData and reduce lock contentions during channel counter update  Summary: Cache the counter updates on thread local data structures and aggregate/publish the data from a separate thread periodically. The ThreadLocalServiceData is implemented on top of the TLStats data structures.  I am plannig to deploy a private build to production tomorrow to test this change in production, but figured it might be better to send the diff out first and get code review feedbacks at the same time.  Test Plan: Run and pass unit tests. Run end-to-end testings on sandbox. (TBD) Deploy a private build to a production server and make sure the thrift call latency is reduced.

a5c13343efce03c97b1b58d2a348d4dc9a0e1f20	fixes for issues encountered in extension dev  We are now investigating HipHop, but for that we need to port our existing PHP extensions. I had to change two small things in hiphop code, to be able to compile it together with one of our extensions. I think these changes could be useful not only for us.  1) Renamed macro "field_type" to "hphp_field_type", because it was making conflicts with mysqlpp library, which have public method "field_type" in some class. It is pretty generic name, so I believe, it could make also problems with other third party libraries in future.  2) At some moment I started to get error messages "error: 'size' is not a member template function" in hiphop, not our code. Don't know exactly why they started to appear, but after some googling I found (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10671406/c-confusing-attribute-name-for-member-template) that this is known GCC bug and workaround is very simple - put parenthesis around "old->size" in hphp/runtime/vm/tread-hash-map.h:203.

caf13651b73251b7b6fcf92674f8d5ea754dd372	Adding "window.phantomCallback()" within the page context.  The callback is harmless: if the user registers a "page.onCallback = [Function]", that will receive any JS type passed via "phantomCallback()". Also, if the handler for ".onCallback" returns a value, that is passed back as a return value of "phantomCallback()".  Also, added "page.onConfirm" and "page.onPrompt". This solves [Issue #133](http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/issues/detail?id=133).

9016abffaf1bead282dd9a4b7cef26d3c264e53d	use setCookie instead of manual header building  Instead of manually constructing a cookie, use the setCookie method provided by Transport. This prevents the following kind of condition:  Imagine:  application runs setcookie with null params to delete a cookie. application runs session_regenerate_id to get a new session id. session_regenerate_id then constructs a new header through m_responseHeaders. Eventually, Transport will generate headers, but will always put m_responseCookies after m_responseHeaders in the full header.  Uh oh! Now we have accidentally deleted a cookie due to incorrect header order.  Closes #950  Differential Revision: D921467

b947636a57ed8332fce4010bf50033160d8a645f	Fix isset($string[$k]) and empty($string[$k]) to match PHP 5.5  The behavior of isset($x[$k]) and empty($x[$k]) where $x is a string has changed in a recent version of PHP. This diff updates HHVM to match PHP 5.5's behavior. Note that HHVM still does not match Zend PHP 5.5 perfectly in terms of warnings for these expressions; I've decided to put that off into a separate diff.  This also brings HHVM up-to-date with respect to some edge cases for automagically converting integer-like string keys to integer keys when indexing into PHP arrays.

A lot of this is related to the lexer/grammar rules for XHP, so an easy solution to fix a lot of these issues is to set EnableXHP=0 by default and to make some changes to the lexer to make it more Zend PHP compatible when EnableXHP=0.

But the sniffs state that it is the trigger that just makes the bunnies cast the teleport spell, so we'll keep that one complicated. This is the penultimate quest of the chain, the final quest is a WIP. Any additional info would be very helpful.  Regards, Kirk.

All of them don't pass because of other missing SPL problems not related to this class (and this class is simple so I wouldn't assume them to blame to it).  Closes #766

722a6c143ae9adbab020df4bae4495e612a677ee	Core/Account: Make account password change security variable and various changes  Settings within worldserver.conf:  Three settings for secruity level: 0 - None - No change to current system 1 - Email - Always requires the email entered on registration for confirming. 2 - RBAC - Groups applied with the RBAC role always require the email entered on registration for confirming.  RBAC default to every group. Changed some logs to make it more clear what is going on at all.  Emails may now no longer exceed 64 chars. Current email is used as regmail.  On account creation, two emails are saved. Registration email and normal email. Normal email is relevant afterwards. Registration email can be changed by console ONLY.  Includes new commands and changes to existing ones: .account fulfills several new functions: * Still prints GM Level. * If account has permission, it displays the current email. This is not defaulted to any group. * Security level is displayed. Also displays if user has RBAC perm if RBAC security mode is selected .account email allows user to change email with sufficient confirmation .account set sec email allows higher sec with higher sec than account to change the normal email. Registrationemail remains untouched here. .account set sec regmail allows console to change registration email. .pinfo now displays the registration and normal mail.  Also fixes .learn all crafts. Closes #10558
